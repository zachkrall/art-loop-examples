# p5.js template for artloop

This is a template for creating [artloop](https://github.com/zachkrall/artloop) comptabile p5.js sketches.

## what is p5.js?

p5.js reference documentation: [(English)](https://p5js.org/reference/) [(EspaÃ±ol)](https://p5js.org/es/reference/) [(ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡)](https://p5js.org/zh-Hans/reference/)

p5.js runs in a browser environment (such as Firefox or Chrome). To allow
p5.js sketches to display with art-loop, we can use
[Electron](https://electronjs.org), an open-source package for creating
cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This means, an HTML page can be displayed as a full-screen app without
using a web browser. Cool!

## what if I'm not comfortable with the command-line

The command-line and terminal environments can be complicated, especially
if you have never used it before. If you are still learning how to use
the command-line, you can remix
[this glitch template](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/art-loop-p5-example?path=js/sketch.js) to create an art-loop compatible sketch
instead.

If you share your Glitch URL, we can bundle it as an electron app for you. ðŸ˜Š
